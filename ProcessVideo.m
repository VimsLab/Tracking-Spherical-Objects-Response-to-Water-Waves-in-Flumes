% Simple script to read a video file and track a single red marker
% in 2D using the hue and saturation values. The largest red blob is 
% detected and the mean co-ordinate position of this blob is tracked. This
% code does not have any tracking built-in: it treats each frame
% idependently.
%
% This assumes that the video is a constant frame rate video. The resulting 
% co-ordinate time series are stored in the variables: t, Xc and Yc.
